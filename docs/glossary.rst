    :math:`A`
        The number of air masses along the line of sight. One air mass is defined 
        as the total astmospheric column when looking at the zenith.

    ADC
        Analog to Digital Converter. A card used to convert an analog signal into 
        a quantized digital signal. Each VEGAS bank contains two ADC cards, one 
        for each polarization. 

    Analog Filter Rack
        A rack in the GBT IF system that contains filters to provide the DCR with
        signals of the proper bandwidth.

    API
        Application Programming Interface. A set of routines, protocols and tools
        that can be used when building software and applications for a specific
        system.

    Argus
        Argus (**not** an acronym) instrument covering 74 - 116 GHz.

    AS
        Active Surface. The surface panels on the GBT whose corner heights can be
        adjusted to form the best possible paraboloidal surface. 

    AstrID
        Astronomer's Integrated Desktop The software tool used for executing
        observations with the GBT.

    baseline
        Baseline is a generic term usually taken to mean the instrumental plus continuum
        bandpass shape in an observed spectrum, or changes in the background level in a 
        continuum observation.

    beam switching
        The Ka-band (26-40 GHz) receiver is the only receiver that can perform beam 
        switching. The switching can route the inputs of each feed to one of two "first
        amplifiers" which allows
