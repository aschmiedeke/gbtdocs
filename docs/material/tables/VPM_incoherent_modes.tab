    Note that low bandwidth modes may be routed differently than high bandwidth modes.

    * When using incoherent dedispersion and and 100 or 200 MHz of bandwidth, Bank A should 
      be the only active bank. The exception to this rule is when using the 342 MHz feed of 
      the prime focus receiver, in which case the IF path is routed to Bank E. Bank A will 
      still be active because it is always the switching signal master.
    * When using coherent dedispersion and 200 MHz of bandwidth, Banks A, C, and D will 
      be active, but only bank C and D will record data. Bank A is active because it is 
      the switching signal master.
    * When using coherent dedispersion and 100 MHz of bandwidth, Banks A and D will be active,
      but only Bank D will record data. Bank A is active because it is the switching signal master.

    The reason for this setup is that the VEGAS FPGA boards cannot be clocked at rates slow enough
    to natively sample 100 or 200 MHz. Instead, they are clocked at a rate of 800 MHz, but only a
    portion of the sampled bandwidth is sent to the HPCs for processing.
