Spectral Configurations
-----------------------

It is good practice for the observer to schedule a short observation towards a 
strong spectral line source at the beginning of each observing session. You 
should process and check the spectra before proceeding with the observations 
to confirm the spectral configuration. It is also important to check the system
temperatures for each beam. Poor configuration choices for the backend will 
sometimes be detected as anomalous system temperatures.
