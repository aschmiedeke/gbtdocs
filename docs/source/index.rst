GBT User Documentation Hub
===========================

The GBT User Documentation Hub is a prototype documentation system under active development. It is meant to consolidate all user documentation to use the GBT and process data obtained with the GBT. 

.. only:: html

    The entire documentation is also available as a :octicon:`file;1em;sd-text-primary` single pdf file from the fly-out menu in the bottom left corner.

-------------------

The hub follows the diataxis approach, where documentation is categorized with the user's need in mind. As a GBT user, you will be able to find Tutorials, How-to Guides, Explanations and Reference material that support your learning and the working aspects of your day-to-day tasks with either practical step-by-step instructions or knowledge-providing material.
