GBTdocs is a prototype *GBT User Documentation Hub* under active development. It is meant to consolidate all user-required documentation to use the GBT and process data obtained with the GBT. 

The Hub follows the diataxis approach, where documentation is categorized with the user's needs in mind. Users will be able to find Tutorials, How-to Guides, Explanations and Reference material that support the learning and working aspects of their day-to-day taks with either practical step-by-step instructions or knowledge-providing material.
