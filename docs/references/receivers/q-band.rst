Q-Band receiver
---------------

The Q-band receiver has two beams with fixed separation, each dual circular polarization.
The feeds have cooled polarizers producing circular polarizations. The internal switching
mode available is frequency switching. The IF Bandwidth is 4 GHz. Calibration is by noise
injection and/or ambient load. The feeds are separated by 57.8" in the cross-elevation direction.
