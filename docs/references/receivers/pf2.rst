Prime Focus 2 (PF2) receiver
----------------------------

The PF2 (0.92 - 1.23 GHz) receiver uses a cooled Field Effect Treansistor (FET) and a corrugated feed horn with an Ortho-Mode Transducer (OMT). 

You can select one of four IF filters in the PF2 receiver. These have bandwidths of 20, 40, 80, 240 MHz.

.. note:: 

   The PF2 feed is unlikely to be considered for installation on the GBT.
