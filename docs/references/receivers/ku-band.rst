Ku-Band receiver
---------------

The Ku-band receiver has two beams on the sky with fixed separation, each with dual circular polarization. 
The feeds have cooled polarizers producing circular polarizations. Internal switching modes are frequency 
and/or IF switching (the switch is after the first amplifiers). You can select IF Bandwidths of 500 or 3000 MHz. 

The two Ku-band feeds are separated by 330" in the cross-elevation direction. There is a noise diode for each
beam (~10% of the system temperature) for flux calibration.
