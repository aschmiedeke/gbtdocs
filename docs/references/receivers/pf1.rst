Prime Focus 1 (PF1) receiver
----------------------------

The PF1 (0.29 - 0.92 GHz) receiver is divided into 4 frequency bands within the same receiver box. The receivers are cooled Field Effect Transistor (FET) amplifiers. The feeds for the lower three bands are short-backfire dipoles, and the feed for the fourth (680-920 MHz) is a corrugated feed horn with an Ortho-Mode Transducer (OMT) polarization splitter. A feed change, required to switch between bands, takes 4 hours and must occur on a scheduled maintenance day.


.. note:: 

   The 450 MHz and 600 MHz PF1 feeds are unlikely to be considered for installation on the GBT.
