Radio Frequency Interference
----------------------------

Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) can be a significant problem for some observations.
The most up-to-date information on the RFI environment at the GBT can be found 
`here <https://greenbankobservatory.org/about/interference-protection/>`__.

Recent scans showing the RFI environment in Green Bank can be found 'here <https://greenbankobservatory.org/gbt-rfi-scans/>`__.
The page also provide instructions for running the GBT RFI GUI and accesssing the 
online RFI webpages, however both of these tools require an NRAO account.

Every observer should check for known RFI around their observing frequencies. If you suspect
that this could have a significant impact on your observations, you should contact your
GBT project friend to decide on an appropriate course of action.

Finally, we strongly encourage observers to report RFI they have seen in their data to gbipg@nrao.edu.
