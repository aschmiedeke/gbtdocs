Radio Frequency Interference
----------------------------

Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) can be a significant problem for some observations.
The most up-to-date information on the RFI environment at the GBT can be found 
`here <http://www.gb.nrao.edu/IPG>`__.

Useful resources, references from the above webpage include a `list of known sources of RFI <https://safe.nrao.edu/wiki/bin/view/GB/Projects/RFIReportsTable>`__ and `plots of RFI monitoring data <https://www.gb.nrao.edu/IPG/rfiarchivepage.html>`__.

Additionally the GBT RFI GUI is now available through the GBO computing network. This 
is a new software tool that generates RFI spectrum plots for receiver and time frame 
specified by the user. To run it, log into any GBO Linux machine, open a terminal window, 
and type ``gbt-rfi-gui``. More information is available `here <https://greenbankobservatory.org/about/interference-protection/rfi-gui-user-guide`.

Every observer should check for known RFI around their observing frequencies. If you suspect
that this could have a significant impact on your observations, you should contact your
GBT project friend to decide on an appropriate course of action.





Mitigation of known RFI signals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some cases, it is possible to turn off a known RFI source. For example, there is an amateur
transponder at about 432 MHz, which we can request be shut down. If there are known RFI signals, 
the user should discuss them with the GBT project friend. Given enough advance warning (days to weeks), 
we may be able to have them shut down during the observing.
