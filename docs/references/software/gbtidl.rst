GBTIDL
######


GBTIDL is an interactive package for reduction and analysis of spectral line data taken with the GBT.
GBTIDL is entirely written in IDL. There is limited support in GBTIDL for GBT continuum data, but it is mainly intended for spectral line data from the spectrometer or spectral processor.

Procedures and Functions
========================

The package consists of a set of straightforward yet flexible calibration, averaging, and analysis
procedures (the "GUIDE" layer) modeled after the UniPOPS and CLASS data reduction philosophies,
a customized plotter with many built-in visualization features, and Data I/O and toolbox functionality 
that can be used for more advanced tasks. GBTIDL makes use of data structures which can also be used
to store intermediate results.
