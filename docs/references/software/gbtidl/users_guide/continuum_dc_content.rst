Contents of the Continuum Data Container
########################################

The following table describes the contents of the continuum data container. It is closely
modeled on SDFITS files.

Unlike the spectral line DC, the continuum DC contains several pointers to arrays (date, 
utc, mjd, longitude axis, latitude axis, lst, azimuth, elevation and subref state) in
addition to the data array. The length of each of these arrays is the same as the data
array. Each element in these arrays corresponds to one integration for that sampler and 
switching state. The frequency at the center of the bandpass is given by the observed
frequency field and is always a topocentric frequency.


In this table, the *Index* column shows the name that each field is known by in the index
file. These are the names returned by the :idl:pro:`listcols` command. If the Index entry 
is blank, that field is not represented in the index file and is not available for selection.
