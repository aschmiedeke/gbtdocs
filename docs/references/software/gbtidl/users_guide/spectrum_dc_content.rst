Contents of the Spectrum Data Container
#######################################

The following table describes the contents of the spectrum data container. It is closely modeled on the contents of SDFITS files.


The column in this table labeled *Index* shows the name that each field is known by in the index file. 
These are the names returned by the :idl:pro:`listcols` command. If the Index entry is blank, that 
field is not represented in the index file and is not available for selection. Note that the 
:idl:pro:`dateobs` index name corresponds to the full DATE-OBS value from the SDFITS file, which
combines the information in the date and utc fields from the data container.

The ``zero_channel`` value is only relevant for data from the spectrometer (ACS). When the N lags are
transformed from lags to frequency space, there are N+1 unique frequencies. The data values are taken
from channels 1 through N and the 0 value is stored in the ZEROCHAN column of the SDFITS file. The value
is not used by any core GBTIDL procedures but is included here for experienced users who wish to make 
use of it.
