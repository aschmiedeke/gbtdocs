<H2>Routine summary</H2>

The routine summary simply provides the calling sequence for each routine in
the file and the first sentence of the detailed description.

<H2>Routine Details</H2>

The routine details sections gives a possibly longer description of the routine
as well as a tables of the parameters and keywords accepted by the routine.

All the parameters and keywords of the routine will be in these tables
regardless if they have been commented using IDLdoc.

<H3>Notes on routine attributes</H3>

See the IDLdoc page for IDLdoc itself for a full listing of the attributes of
a routine.

            programming.
