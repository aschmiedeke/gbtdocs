These files were downloaded from the IDL Astronomy User's Library at 
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/ on 17 Jun 2016.

This is the entire pro directory of the IDL Astronomy User's Library 
as found in astron.dir.tar.gz.  It is included here so that GBTIDL users 
need not install the library prior to using GBTIDL and also to ensure 
that GBTIDL is compatable with the version of the IDL Astronomy User's 
Library that is actually used.

The full contents of that tar file also contain text files that users
may find useful.  User's interested in those files should get them from
the original source - they are not included with the GBTIDL distribution.
