    """
    An utility scan. The intent of this scan type is to automatically peak and focus the antenna
    for the current location on the sky and with the current receiver. Therefore it should not
    require any user input. However, by setting any of the optional arguments the user may partially
    or fully override the search and/or procedural steps as described below.

    Warning
    -------
        AutoPeakFocus() should not be used with Prime Focus receivers. The prime focus receivers have 
        pre-determined focus positions and there is not enough travel in the feed to move them significantly
        out of focus.

    AutoPeakFocus() will execute its own default continuum configuration unless “configure=False”
    is supplied as an optional argument, which is not recommended in general unless one knows the
    system well.


    Parameters
    ----------
    
    source: str
        It specifies the name of a particular source in the pointing catalog or in a user-defined
        Catalog. Specifying a source bypasses the search process. Please note that NVSS source names
        are used in the pointing catalog. If the name is not located in the pointing catalog then all
        the user-specified catalogs previously defined in the Scheduling Block are searched. If the
        name is not in the pointing catalog or in the user defined catalog(s) then the procedure fails.

    location:
        A Catalog source name or Location object. It specifies the center of the search radius. The 
        default is the antenna’s current beam location on the sky. Planets and other moving objects
        may **not** be used.

    frequency: float
        It specifies the observing frequency in MHz. The default is the rest frequency used by the
        standard continuum configurations, or the current configuration value if ``configure=False``.

    flux: float
        It specifies the minimum acceptable calibration flux in Jy at the observing frequency. The
        default is 20 times the continuum point-source sensitivity.

    radius: float
        The routine selects the closest calibrator within the radius (in degrees) having the minimum
        acceptable flux. The default radius is 10 degrees. If no calibrator is found within the radius,
        the search is continued out to 180 degrees and if a qualified calibrator is found the user is
        given the option of using it [default], aborting the scan, or continuing the scheduling block
        without running this procedure.

    balance: bool
        Controls whether after slewing to the calibrator the routine balances the power along the IF path
        and again to set the power levels just before collecting data. Allowed values are True or False.

    configure: bool
        This argument causes the telescope to configure for continuum observing for the specified receiver.
        
        .. note::
            
            Because AutoPeakFocus() is self-configuring when set to True, you must re-configure the GBT IF
            path for your science observations after the pointing and focus observations are done. If set to
            False, then no configuration is done, and the observer must ensure that the system is properly
            configured first before running the command.

    beamName: str
        It specifies which receiver beam will be the center of the cross-scan. beamName can be ‘C’, ‘1’, ‘2’,
        ‘3’, ‘4’, etc, up to ‘7’ for the KFPA receiver. This keyword should not be specified unless there is
        an issue with the default beams used for pointing. 

    refBeam: str
        It specifies which beam will be the reference beam for subtracting the sky contribution for the pointing
        observations. The name strings are the same as for the ``beamName`` argument. This keyword should not be
        specified unless there is an issue with the default beams used for pointing. The KFPA and Argus
        have backup beam pairs that can be used for pointing and focus if there is an issue with one of the
        default beams. The valid beam pairs for the KFPA are ``beamName='4'``, ``refBeam='6'`` (default beam pair) 
        or ``beamName='3'``, ``refBeam='7'`` (backup beam pair), while the valid beam pairs for Argus are ``beamName='10'``,
        ``refBeam='11'`` (default beam pair) or ``beamName='14'``, ``refBeam='15'`` (backup beam pair). 

    elAzOrder: bool
        If True, the elevation peak scans will be done first before the azimuth peak scans. This can be helpful
        for high-frequency observations (> 40GHz) to provide more successful initial pointing solutions, since
        the elevation pointing offsets are typically larger than the azimuth offsets. The default is False, 
        for which the azimuth pointing scans will be done before the elevation scans.

    calSeq: bool
        If True, then for 'Rcvr68_92' (W-Band) the observations will be preceeded by calibration calSeq observations,
        or for 'RcvrArray75_115' (Argus) the calibration “vanecal” observations. If False, then the calibration
        vanecal or calSeq observations will be skipped. This keyword is only applicable for receivers operating
        above 66 GHz, and the associated calibration observations depend on the receiver ('Rcvr68_92',
        'RcvrArray75_115', and 'Rcrv_PAR') and the particular Auto utilty procedure (see the individual receiver
        chapters for specifics). The default value is True.

    gold: bool
        If True then only “Gold standard sources” (.i.e. sources suitable for pointing at high frequencies) will be
        used by :func:`AutoPeakFocus() <astrid_commands.AutoPeakFocus>`. This parameter is ignored if the ``source`` parameter is specified.


    AutoPeakFocus will use the default scanning rates and lengths listed in Table 7.6.

If no pointing source is found within the specified radius, then provide the observer the option to use a more distant source (default), and if none found either aborting (second default) or continuing the scheduling block.
        7. Slew to source.

        default is the antenna’s current beam location on the sky. Planets and other moving objects
        may not be used.

    frequency: float
        It specifies the observing frequency in MHz. The default is the rest frequency used by the

    radius: float
        The routine selects the closest calibrator within the radius (in degrees) having the minimum

    balance: bool
        Controls whether after slewing to the calibrator the routine balances the power along the IF path
        and again to set the power levels just before collecting data. Allowed values are True or False.

    configure: bool
        This argument causes the telescope to configure for continuum observing for the specified receiver.
        
        .. note::
            
            Because AutoFocus() is self-configuring when set to True, you must re-configure the GBT IF
            path for your science observations after the pointing and focus observations are done. If set to
            False, then no configuration is done, and the observer must ensure that the system is properly
            configured first before running the command.

    beamName: str
        It specifies which receiver beam will be the center of the cross-scan. ``beamName`` can be 'C', '1', '2',
        '3', '4', etc, up to '7' for the KFPA receiver. This keyword should not be specified unless there is
        an issue with the default beams used for pointing. 

    refBeam: str
        It specifies which beam will be the reference beam for subtracting the sky contribution for the pointing

        (backup beam pair). 


    calSeq: bool
        If True, then for 'Rcvr68_92' (W-Band) the observations will be preceeded by calibration calSeq observations,
        or for 'RcvrArray75_115' (Argus) the calibration “vanecal” observations. If False, then the calibration

        The example OOF command above is applicable for all receivers, and users should refer to the individual
        receiver chapters to understand the specifics on how the OOF data are calibrated via the calSeq keyword.
        For Ka-band, the default backend for the AutoOOF procedure is the CCB. Besides the much higher sensitivity
        provided by the CCB (a fast beam-switching backend designed for continuum measurements), the larger beam at
        lower frequency makes the surface solutions less affected by winds. Since the Ka+CCB system provides the most
        accurate measurements of the surface parameters, it should be used whenever possible.

        Users should refrain from using non-standard defaults for the AutoOOF measurements since the processing
        software is customized per receiver based on the default parameters (e.g., avoid running an AutoOOF at
        a non-default frequency or pre-configuring and running with the configuration=False keyword).

        Catalog source name or Location object. It specifies the source upon which to do the scan.

    hLength : Offset object
        Specifies the horitzontal distance used for the Peak. ``hLength`` values may be negative.
        The default value is the recommended value for the receiver.

    vLength : Offset object
        Specifies the vertical distance used for the Peak. ``vLength`` values may be negative. 
        The default value is the recommended value for the receiver.

    scanDuration : float

        value for the receiver.

    beamName : str
        Specifies the receiver beam to use for the scan. Make sure that you configure with
        the same beam with which you Peak.

    refBeam : str

    elAzOrder : bool
        If True, the elevation peak scans will be done first before the azimuth peak scans.
        This can be helpful for high-frequency observations (>40 GHz) since the elevation
        pointing offsets are typically larger than the azimuth offsets.


    Caution
    -------
        ``hLength``, ``vLength`` and ``scanDuration`` should be overridden as an unit since
        together they determine the rate.

    .. warning:: 

        Use only if you really know what you're doing!

    **Parameters**
    
    *device: str*
        A string that may take the following values: ``'IFRack'``, ``'DCR_AF'``, ``'GUPPI'``,
        ``'vlbi'``, ``'VEGAS'``, ``'RcvrPF_1'``, ``'RcvrPF_2'``.

    *{option: value}:*
        An optional parameter to the Balance() function. Can be a Python dictionary containing
        one or more of the balancing options listed below. Items which are not in the dictionary
        are assigned their default values and non-applicable options are ignored.

        **option** is a string used to control the balancing. The allowed **value** types depend
        on the option:

        * ``'target_level'``: The target balancing level for the specified device. 
            * value is a float. 
            * Default values vary by device.

        * ``'port'``: Used to specify which ports to balance.
            * value is an integer list (e.g. [1,2,9,10]). VEGAS ports are in the range of 1-16.
            * The default is to balance all ports.

        * ``'sample_time'``: Only applicable when balancing the prime focus receivers. 
            The prime focus balance API will try and balance the receiver over a period of ``sample_time``
            seconds. This will be repeated a maximum of 6 times or until the power level is within 20% of
            the target_level.

            * value is an integer between 1 and 41 seconds. 
            * The default is 2.

        * ``'cal'``: Turns the noise diodes on or off when balancing the prime focus receivers.
            * value can be either ``'on'`` or ``'off'``. 
            * The default is ``'on'``.

    **Usage**

    .. code-block:: 

        Balance('RcvrPF_1', {'sample_time': 5, 'cal': 'on'})
        Balance('VEGAS', {'target_level': -20})

def BalanceOnOff(location, offset=None, beamName='1'):

    """
    An utility scan. When there is a large difference in power received by the GBT between two positions
    on the sky, it is advantageous to balance the IF system power levels to be at the mid-point of the
    two power levels. Typically this is needed when the "source position" is a strong continuum source.
    This scan type has been created to handle this scenario; one chouls consider using it when the system 
    temperature on and off source differ by a factor of two or more.

    The BalanceOnOff() slews to the source position and then balances the IF system. It then determines
    the power levels that are observed in the IF Rack. Then the telescope is slewed to the off position
    and the power levels are determined again. The change in the power levels is then used to determine
    attenuator settings that put the balance near the mid-point of the observed power range. Note that 
    the balance is determined only to within +/-0.5 dB owing to the integer settings of the IF Rack
    attenuators.

    
    Parameters
    ----------

    location: 
        A Catalog source name or Location object. It specifies the source of which the telescope should
        slew. The default is the current location in "J2000" coordinate mode.

    offset: Offset object
        It moves the beam to an optional offset position that is specified relative to 
        the location specified in the location parameter value. 

    beamName: str
        It specifies the receiver beam to use for the scan. beamName can be 'C', '1', '2', '3', '4', or 
        any valid combination for the receiver you are using such as 'MR12'.

    """
    An observing scan. The Track scan type follows a sky location while taking data.
    
    
    Parameters
    ----------

    location: 
        A Catalog source name or Location object. It specifies the source which is to be tracked.

    endOffset: Offset object
        Supplying an endOffset object with a value other than None will track the telescope across
        the sky at constant velocity. The scan will start at the specified location and end at
        (location+endOffset) after scanDuration seconds. If you wish to only track a single location
        rather than slew the telescope between two points, use None for this parameter.

    beamName: str
        It specifies the receiver beam to use for the scan. beamName can be 'C', '1', '2', '3', '4', or 
        any valid combination for the receiver you are using such as 'MR12'.

    startTime: Time object
        This specifies when the scan begins in the Universal Time (UT). If startTime is in the past
        then the scan starts as soon as possible with a message sent to the scan log. If (startTime +
        scanDuration) is in the past, then the scan is skipped with a message to the observation log. 
        The value may be

        - **A time object:** Note, if ``startTime`` is more than ten minutes in the future then a 
          message is sent to the observation log. 
        - **A Horizon object:** The following script implicitely calculates the startTime using Horizon():

          .. code-block:: python

            Track('VirgoA', None, 120.0, startTime=horizon, startTime=Horizon())

          If the source never rises then the scan is skipped and if the source never sets then the scan
          is started immediately. In either case a message is sent to the observation log. 

    stopTime: Time object
        This specifies when the scan completes. If stopTime is in the past then the scan is skipped with
        a message to the observation log.

        - **A Horizon Object:** When a Horizon object is used, the stop time is implicitely computed. 
          The following lines in an SB would track VirgoA from rise to set using a horizon of 20 degree:

          .. code-block:: python

            horizon = Horizon(20.0)
            Track('VirgoA', None, 120.0, startTime=horizon, stopTime=horizon)
        
          If the source never sets, then the scan stop time is set to 12 hours from the current time. 
 
    fixedOffset: Offset object
        Track follows the sky location plus this fixed Offset. The ``fixedOffset`` may be in a different
        coordinate mode than the ``location``. If an ``endOffset`` is also specified, Track starts at 
        (location+fixedOffset), and ends at (location+fixedOffset+endOffset). The ``fixedOffset`` and
        ``endOffset`` must be both of the same coordinate mode, but may be of a different mode than the
        ``location``. The ``fixedOffset`` parameter may be omitted.
        

    Note
    -------

        Scan timing must be specified by either 
            * a ``scanDuration``, 
            * a ``stopTime``,
            * a ``startTime`` plus ``stopTime``, or
            * a ``startTime`` plus ``scanDuration``.

        For example, if we had previously configured for Rcvr26 40 and an integration time of
        1.5 sec- onds (``tint=1.5`` in the configuration), example 2 above would blank roughly
        one out of every three integrations in a half-cycle (``nodLength=3``) while the subreflector was
        moving between beams. If ``nodLength=5``, then only one in five integrations would be blanked.
        A resonable compromise in terms of performance and to minimize the amount of data blanked
        is to use subBeamNod with an integration time of 0.2s and a ``nodLength=30`` (6 sec nodding 
        between beams). It is important to use a small tint value to avoid blanking too much data
        (e.g., 0.5 sec or less).

        The subBeamNod mode is useful to produce good baselines for the measurement of broad
        extra-galactic lines. For Ka-band, Q-band, and Argus, the performance of subBeamNod is
        signficantly better than Nod observations. For W-band and the KFPA, the beams are farther
        apart and the subBeamNod technique does not work as well, and users are recommended to use 
        Nod observations.

        The antenna uses the average position of the two beams for tracking the target, and SDFITS
        reports the positions of the beams relative to the tracking position. Although the SDFITS
        header postion will not match the target position, SubBeamNod successfully nods between the
        two beams during the scan. Control of the subreflector may be done with any scan type using
        the submotion class. This should only be done by expert observers. Those observers interested
        in using this class should contact their GBT “Friend”.

    """
    A mapping scan. A Right Ascension/Longitude (RALong) map performs an on-the-fly (OTF) raster scan centered
    on a sky location. Scans are performed along the major axis of the selected coordinate system.
    One can map in a variety of corrdinate systems, including J2000, Galactic, and AzEl. The
    selected coordinate system is defined by the coordinateMode keyword for the Offset object.
    The starting point of the map is defined as (-``hLength``/2, -``vLength``/2) from the specified center
    location.

    Parameters
    ----------

    location:
        A Catalog source name or Location object. It specifies the center of the map.

    hLength:
        An Offset object. It specifies the horizontal width of the map (i.e., the extent in the
        longitude-like direction). hLength values may be negative.

    vLength:
        An Offset object. It specifies the vertical height of the map (i.e., the extent in the
        latitude-like direction). vLength values may be negative.

    vDelta: 
        An Offset object. It specifies the distance between map rows. ``vDelta`` values must be
        positive. 

    scanDuration: float
        It specifies the length of each scan in seconds.

    beamName: str
        It specifies the receiver beam to use for the scan. ``beamName`` can be 'C', '1', '2', '3', '4'
        or any valid combination for the receiver you are using such as 'MR12'.

    unidirectional: bool
        It specifies whether the map is unidirectional (True) or boustrophedonic (False;
        from the Greek meaning "as the ox plows", i.e. back and forth).

    start: int
        It specifies the starting row for the map. This is useful for doing parts of a map at
        different times. For example, if map has 42 rows, one can do rows 1-12 by setting 
        ``start=1, stop=12``, and later finishing the map using ``start=13, stop=42``.

    stop: int
        It specifies the stopping row for the map. The default is ``None``, meaning "go to the end".


    Note
    ----
    Observers should limit scanDuration so that no more than 2 scans (or accelerations)
    are performed per minute. Overhead is ∼20 seconds per scan.


    Example
    --------
    The following script produces a map with 41 rows each 120 arcmin long, using a row spacing
    of 3 arcmin and scan rate of 20 arcmin/min with beam 1 (default). 

    .. code-block:: python

        RALongMap('NGC4258',                                    # center of the map
                  Offset('J2000', 2.0, 0.0, cosv=True),         # 120 arcmin width
                  Offset('J2000', 0.0, 2.0, cosv=True),         # 120 arcmin height
                  Offset('J2000', 0.0, 0.05, cosv=True),        # 3 arcmin row spacing
                  360.0)                                        # 6 minutes per row


    Caution
    -------
    Observers should ensure that they are sampling sufficiently in the scanning direction when using
    OTF mapping. In this example data were recorded every 5 seconds (``tint=5.0`` in the configuration).
    This results in one sample every 1.67arcmin in the scanning direction using the above scan rate 
    of 20arcmin/min. This is suitable for observations at 1420 MHz, where the FWHM of the beam is 
    8.8 arcmin. as the beam will be sampled at least 5 times.

    """
    A mapping scan. The Daisy scan type performs an OTF scan around a central point in the form of daisy petals. It is a 
    useful observing mode for focal plane arrays, allowing more integration time in the central field of
    view. The Daisy scan will produce an approximately closed circular pattern on the sky after 22 radial
    oscillation periods.

    .. todo::

        Add figure 5.6 from the Observer's Guide above. Same issue with the x-axis here as in the figures
        for RALongMap, DecLatMap etc.


    
    For beamsizes of 20 arcsec FWHM or so, the circular area mapped will be fully sampled if the map radius
    is less than 6 arcmin. It is not an especially useful observing mode for general-purpose single-beam mapping,
    since the largest “hole” in the map is ~0.3× the map radius.

    Trajectories are generated according to 


    :math:`\Delta \hat{x}(t) = \\frac{r_0 sin(2\pi t/\\tau + \phi_1) cos(2t/\\tau + \phi_2)}{cos(\hat{y}_0)}`

    and

    :math:`\Delta \hat{y}(t) = r_0 sin(2\pi t/\\tau + \phi_1) sin(2t/\\tau + \phi_2),`    

    where 
    :math:`\hat{x}` and :math:`\hat{y}` are the major and minor coordinates of a sperical coordinate system,
    :math:`t` is the time, 
    :math:`r_0` is the map radius, 
    :math:`\\tau` is the radial oscillation period,
    :math:`\phi_1` and :math:`\phi_2` are the radial and rotational phases, and
    :math:`\hat{y}_0` is the minor coordinate of the map center.
    

    Parameters
    ----------

    location:
        A Catalog source name or Location object. It specifies the center of the map.

    map_radius: float
        :math:`r_0` in equation above. It specifies the radius of the map’s “daisy petals” in arcmin.

    radial_osc_period: float
        :math:`\\tau` in the equations above. It specifies the period of the radial oscillation in seconds.

        .. caution::

            Not to be less than 15 sec x :math:`\sqrt{r_0/1.5 arcmin}` for radii > 1.5 arcmin and in no
            case under 15 seconds.

    radial_phase: float
        :math:`\phi_1` in equations above. It specifies the radial phase in radians.

    rotation_phase: float
        :math:`\phi_2` in equations above. It specifies the rotational phase in radians.

    scanDuration: float
        It specifies the length of the scan in seconds.

    beamName: str. 
        It specifies the receiver beam to use for both scans. ``beamName`` can be 'C', '1', '2', '3', '4'
        or any valid combination for the receiver you are using such as 'MR12'. 

    cos_v: bool
        It specifies whether secant minor corrections (the :math:`cos(\hat{y}_0)` term in the first equation
        above should be used for the major axis of the coordinate system. 

    coordMode: str
        It specifies the coordinate mode for the radius that generates the map.

    calc_dt: float
        It specifies time sampling used by the control system to calculate a path. Values should be between
        0.1 and 0.5. Calculating many points for a long daisy scan can significantly increase overhead at
        scan startup.
    

    Note
    -------
    It takes approximately 22 radial oscillation periods to complete a closed Daisy pattern. However,
    ``radial_osc_period`` is typically set to be in the range of 15–60 seconds depending on the
    radius being used. As an example, 22 oscillations of 20 seconds would take 440 seconds. If a long
    trajectory such as this is sent to the antenna manager, intrinsic inefficiencies in the array handling
    mechanism can significantly increase overhead at the start of a scan. Therefore one should try to
    keep individual scans to 5 minutes or less.


    Example
    -------
    The script below will do 22 radial periods over 5 scans lasting 110 seconds each. The ``rotation_phase``
    and ``radial_phase`` arguments are used so that each scan starts where the previous scan finished. This
    will produce the closed Daisy pattern. The entire SB should take approximately
    10 minutes to complete.

    ----
    The information in a FITS KEYWORD created via the Annotation() function will be ignored by the standard

def Break(message="Observation paused.", timeout=300.0):

    """
    An utility function. It inserts a breakpoint into your SB and gives you the choice of continuing 
    or terminating the SB. When a breakpoint is encountered during execution, your SB is paused and a
    pop-up window is created. The SB remains paused for a set amount of time or until you acknowledge
    the pop-up window and tell Astrid to continue running your script.

    The Break() function can take two optional arguments, a message string and a timeout length.

    Parameters
    ----------

    message: str
        Displayed in the pop-up dialog with a default of “Observation paused”.

    timeout: float
        The number of seconds to get user-input before continuing the SB. If you wish for the timeout to
        last forever then use ``None``. The default is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes.

        .. note::
            
            Why have a timeout? If an observer walks away from the control room during his or her observing
            session (e.g. to go to lunch or the bathroom) and a breakpoint is reached, it would be 
            counterproductive to pause the observation indefinitely. This will help save valuable

def Horizon(elevation=5.25):

    """
    A scheduling block object. Observing Scripts allow an observer to specify a definition of the horizon. 
    The user defined horizon can be used to begin an observation when an object "rises" and/or end the
    observation when it "sets" relative to the specified elevation of the “horizon”. The Horizon object
    may be used to obtain the initial time that a given source is above the specified horizon (including 
    an approximate atmospheric refraction correction).

    
    Parameters
    ----------

    location:
        A Catalog source name or Location object using a spherical coordinate mode. Horizon() will not work
        with planets and ephemeris tables.

    elevation: float. 
        The Horizon elevation in degrees. The default is 5.25 (the nominal GBT horizon limit).

        
    Return Value: 
        A UTC time object containing the UTC time and date.

        .. admonition:: Horizon(elevation).GetRise(location)

            Will return the most recent rise time if the source is currently above the horizon, or the next
            rise time if the source has not yet risen. GetRise(source) will return None if the source never
            rises and the current time if the source never sets.


        .. admonition:: Horizon(elevation).GetSet(location)

            Will return the next set time of the source. GetSet(source) will return None if the
            source never sets and the current time if the source never rises.


    Examples
    --------
    Any Horizon object may be substituted as a start or stop time in scan types, such as Track(). The script
    below will display the time when VirgoA rises above 20◦ elevation. Depending on the position of the source
    at the time of execution, the SB would then either begin a Track() scan immediately or wait for VirgoA
    to rise above 5.25◦ elevation before beginning the scan. In both cases, the SB would terminate the next 
    time VirgoA sets below 5.25◦ elevation.

    .. code-block:: python

        print Horizon(20.0).GetRise('VirgoA')

        h = Horizon()                           #default horizon of 5.25 degrees elevation  
        Track('VirgoA', None, startTime=h, stopTime=h)

def TimeObject():

    """
    The Time Object is primarily used for defining scan start or stop times. The time may be represented as
    either a sexegesimal string or in a python mxDateTime object. You can learn more about mxDateTime at
    http://www.egenix.com/files/python/mxDateTime.html.

    .. note::

        One must access the python DateTime module directly from an observation script to generate
        time objects, i.e., using from mx import DateTime.

    The Time Object can be expressed in either UTC or LST. The time can be either absolute or relative.
    An absolute or dated time specifies both the time of day and the date. An absolute time may be
    represented by either a sexagesimal string, i.e., "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss" or by a DateTime object. 
    Relative or dateless times are specified by the time of day for "today". "WaitFor" will treat a dateless 
    time that is more than 30 minutes in the past as being in the future, i.e., the next day. Relative times 
    may be represented by either a sexagesimal string, i.e., "hh:mm:ss" or a DateTimeDelta object. For UTC
    times, the sexagesimal representation may include a “UTC" suffix. Note that mxDate-Time objects are always
    UTC. LST time may only be used with relative times and the sexagesimal representation must include a "LST"
    suffix. Time Objects can have slightly varying formats and can be created in a few different ways.

    Some examples are
        - Absolute time in UTC represented by a string: 
            **"2006-03-22 15:34:10"**
        - Relative time in UTC as a mxDateTime object: 
            **DateTime.TimeDelta(12, 0, 0)**
        - Absolute time in UTC represented by a string: 
            **"2006/03/22 15:34:10 UTC"**
        - Relative time in LST as a string: 
            **"22:15:48 LST"**
        - Absolute time in UTC as a mxDateTime object: 
            **DateTime.DateTime(2006, 1, 21, 3, 45, 0)**
        
    Examples
    --------
    In this example we will continue to do one minute observations of srcA until Feb 12, 2016 at 13:15 UTC when
    we will then do a ten minute observations of srcB.

    The CalSeq procedure is used to calibrate W-band data. This procedure should be
    run after every configuration and balance. This is needed to convert instrumental 
    counts into antenna temperatures.

    Parameters
    ----------

    type: 
        string keyword to indicate type of calibration scan: manual, auto, autocirc

        - "manual" -- A separate scan will be done for each table position. The user can
          input a list of calibration table wheel positions with the tablePositionList argument.
        - "auto" -- default dwell fraction =(0.33, 0.33, 0.34) and default three
          positions = (Observing, Cold1, Cold2). The user can specify a list of positions and 
          dwell times with the tablePostionList and dwellFractionList arguments.
        - "autocirc" -- dwell fraction =(0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25) and four positions = 
          (Observing, [Position2 for beamName='1' or Position5 for beamName='2' for use 
          with circular VLBI observations], Cold1, Cold2).
    
    scanDuration:
        scan exposure time, in seconds. For manual mode, each specified position will be
        observed for the scan exposure time (i.e., separate scans for each position). For 
        auto modes, the total scan exposure time will be divided between positions based
        on the dwell fractions (i.e., one scan for all positions).

    location:
        a Catalog source name or Location object; default is None (use current location).
    
    beamName: 
        Beam name associated with pointing location. This argument is a string.
        Default beam is '1'.
    
    fixedOffset: 
        offset sky position (used in cases when observing a bright source and want to measure
        the system temperature of the sky off-source). This argument should be an Offset 
        object. Default sky offset is 0.
    
    tablePositionList: 
        user-specified, variable-length ordered list of cal table positions for the manual
        or auto modes.  The default sequence is ['Observing', 'Cold1', 'Cold2'].
    
    dwellFractionList:
        user-specified, ordered list of dwell fractions associated with the tablePositionList 
        for use only with the auto mode. By using auto mode with tablePositionList and 
        dwellFractionList, expert users can control the wheel in any order of positions
        and dwell fractions. This input is not needed for autocirc or manual modes and is
        ignored in these modes if given.
